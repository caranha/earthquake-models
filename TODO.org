* CSEP Evolutionary Model Program
- [X] Reading earthquakes from files, filtering them by time and
  space.
- [X] Define an interface for N-dimensional models 
  (So I can define the definitions by parameter file)
- [X] 2-dimensional model (latitude, longitude)
- [X] Assign events to model from data
- [X] Generate random model (from Total number of earthquakes)

- [X] Change Parameter file to use "start position, grid size, grid delta"
- [X] Change drawing to draw squares over image
- [X] log likelihood
- [ ] Random Search

- [ ] Simple GA Search
- [ ] Simple model suggested years before by Bogdan



* Earthquake Browsing GUI
** TODO Complex Filtering Pane
** TODO Simple Filtering Pane
   - [ ] Filtering by Aftershocks (number, radius, fault plane, time)
   - [X] Filtering by Date
   - [X] Filtering by Focus Earthquake (aftershocks of this quake, time, fault plane, radius)

** TODO Focus Pane
   - [ ] Can send quake to "bookmarks" pane
   - [ ] Can create "radius" draw element (how do I find out the pixel size?)
   - [ ] Can be cleared
   - [X] Show detailed info about a quake
   - [X] Can create "radius", "pane" element

** TODO Fault Plane Data
   - [ ] Create "japan map"/"fault map"

** TODO Bookmark Pane
   - [ ] Receive new elements from "Focus Pane"
   - [ ] Can delete individual elements
   - [ ] Can send one of the elements to Focus Pane
   - [ ] Shows brief information about highlighted quake
** TODO Issues - 2
   - [ ] Model starts empty (no quakes, and has option to load earthquake data files)
   - [ ] System is able to detect JMA or FNET files (or map files)
   - [ ] DrawCommand Panel Should only talk to "model", not "MapController"
   - [ ] Remove "getMapController" from model.
     
** DONE Map Display Pane
   - [X] Color and name should be changeable
   - [X] Each display element should be toggleable (visible/invisible)
   - [X] Each display element should be destroyable
   - [X] Each display element should have a color and a name
** DONE List Pane
   - [X] Can send Earthquake to Focus Pane
   - [X] Show short info of highlighted Earthquake
   - [X] Does not know who has Focus (remove focus quake)
   - [X] Show number of current earthquakes
   - [X] Create Display element with all currently listed quakes

** DONE Structure
   - [X] Create Singleton for the model (Map Controller)
   - [X] Make map view the model and redraw on updates

** DONE Issues
   - [X] Earthquakes in "draw earthquake" are ugly
   - [X] Map does not update automatically when adding earthquakes
