* Test All quakes program:
  This program:
  1- reads a number of files with earthquakes, either in the JMA or FNET formats
  2- choose candidate earthquake for analysis, based on parameters (depth, strength, etc)
  3- for each choosen earthquake, execute the available model tests:
     Point in Place, Distance from Plane, Distance from fault
  4- For each model test, Choose:
     - The test starts inconclusive, then chooses one model
     - The test starts with one model, then turns inconclusive
     - The test is inconclusive all around
     - The test is contradictory (starts with one model, and changes to another)
  5- Totalize these values:
     - Number of types 1 and 2 for each model
     - Earthquakes where: N models agree on the earthquake type

** Main goals
   - [ ] Calculate totals for "Inconclusive", "N" won, Contradictory
   - [ ] Print different results to different files

** Improvement goals
   - [ ] Ability to run "Test All Quakes" with time quanta of different size
   - [ ] Ability to run "Test All Quakes" with different number of quanta
   - [ ] Ability to run "Test All Quakes" on different data files

** Plane-Distance testing
   - [ ] Calculate the distance between one point and the quake plane
   - [ ] Model judgement based on mean squared distance (error)
   - [ ] Is distance based on "in plane" distances for that model? or for both models?

** Fault distance testing
   - [ ] Calculate whether a fault is inside or outside the fault plane
   - [ ] Compare faults inside the fault plane with the strike direction

** Done
- [X] Selects a subgroup of valid earthquakes
  Valid earthquakes have Magnitude > X, and aftershocks with mag > Z after 1 day > Y
- [X] Calcular a hypothesis do plano para cada time period
- [X] Imprimir o resultado para cada time period

* New GUI:
- [ ] Create GUI outline

*** Japanese Map
    - [ ] Show/Hide Faults
    - [ ] Zoom/Move around
*** Filter earthquakes 
    - [ ] Magnitude
    - [ ] Depth
    - [ ] Fault Model
*** Earthquake-Of-Interest List
    - [ ] Add/Remove
    - [ ] Display Location (toggle)
    - [ ] Display Plane
    - [ ] Display Aftershocks

*** Hypothesis
    - [ ] Filter earthquakes by hypothesis (differentiated by hypothesis)
    - [ ] For one earthquake, show hypothesis info
    - [ ] Show hypothesis info on map: Nearest fault, points in plane, etc.

** Refactoring:
- [ ] Fault model information in event is represented by two FaultModel objects

** Map and Fault information
*** GeoLine Object
    Contains a "geoline": A fault line, a shoreline, etc. A geoline is
    composed of multiple points.
    - [X] Basic data (point vector)
    - [X] Draw method (receives color and drawing context)
    - [ ] Crosses Box (tests if any point of the Geoline is inside the
      box.
    - [ ] Distance from line (calculates the distance between a
      straight line segment and the geoline object. This is needed to
      test if a fault is related to an event. (How to do this?)

*** GeoLineCollection Object
    Contains a group of Geolines. Mostly used for organizing them,
    multiple printing, etc.
    - [X] Reading from a file;
    - [X] Printing everything to an image (receives color, context);
    - [ ] Select a subset of geolines that crosses a rectangle;
