* TASKLIST
** Goal: Add ability to read and display map and fault information
*** GeoLine Object
    Contains a "geoline": A fault line, a shoreline, etc. A geoline is
    composed of multiple points.
    - [ ] Basic data (point vector)
    - [ ] Draw method (receives color and drawing context)
    - [ ] Crosses Box (tests if any point of the Geoline is inside the
      box.
    - [ ] Distance from line (calculates the distance between a
      straight line segment and the geoline object. This is needed to
      test if a fault is related to an event. (How to do this?)

*** GeoLineCollection Object
    Contains a group of Geolines. Mostly used for organizing them,
    multiple printing, etc.
    - [ ] Reading from a file;
    - [ ] Printing everything to an image (receives color, context);
    - [ ] Select a subset of geolines that crosses a rectangle;

** Goal: Streamline hypothesis testing
*** FaultModel Object
    This object stores information about one fault model
    - [ ] Base FM data (Strike, Dip, Rake)
    - [ ] Plate rectangle
