* New GUI
** List Pane
   - [ ] Can send Earthquake to Focus Pane
   - [X] Show short info of highlighted Earthquake
   - [X] Does not know who has Focus (remove focus quake)
   - [X] Show number of current earthquakes
   - [X] Create Display element with all currently listed quakes

** Filtering Pane
   - [ ] Filtering by Date
   - [ ] Filtering by Aftershocks (number, radius, fault plane, time)
   - [ ] Filtering by Focus Earthquake (aftershocks of this quake, time, fault plane, radius)

** Map Display Pane
   - [X] Each display element should have a color and a name
   - [ ] Color and name should be changeable
   - [ ] Each display element should be toggleable (visible/invisible)
   - [ ] Each display element should be destroyable

** Focus Pane
   - [ ] Show detailed info about a quake
   - [ ] Can send quake to "bookmarks" pane
   - [ ] Can create "radius", "pane" element
   - [ ] Can be cleared

** Fault Plane Data
   - [ ] Create "japan map"/"fault map"

** Bookmark Pane
   - [ ] Receive new elements from "Focus Pane"
   - [ ] Can delete individual elements
   - [ ] Can send one of the elements to Focus Pane
   - [ ] Shows brief information about highlighted quake


** Structure
   - [X] Create Singleton for the model (Map Controller)
   - [X] Make map view the model and redraw on updates

** Issues
   - [X] Earthquakes in "draw earthquake" are ugly
   - [X] Map does not update automatically when adding earthquakes

* Test All quakes program:
  This program:
  1- reads a number of files with earthquakes, either in the JMA or FNET formats
  2- choose candidate earthquake for analysis, based on parameters (depth, strength, etc)
  3- for each choosen earthquake, execute the available model tests:
     Point in Place, Distance from Plane, Distance from fault
  4- For each model test, Choose:
     - The test starts inconclusive, then chooses one model
     - The test starts with one model, then turns inconclusive
     - The test is inconclusive all around
     - The test is contradictory (starts with one model, and changes to another)
  5- Totalize these values:
     - Number of types 1 and 2 for each model
     - Earthquakes where: N models agree on the earthquake type

** Extras:
   - [X] Creates a parameter object for loading parameters
   - [X] Use parameter objects to load parameters
   - [ ] Make "Datalist" try to load the file from the filesystem
     first, and if it does not find it there, try the internal asset folder
     - Same for loading default parameter values
   - [ ] Remove the "parameter variables" and replace them with parameter calls 
     with default values in TestAllQuakes.

** Main goals
   - [ ] Calculate totals for "Inconclusive", "N" won, Contradictory
   - [ ] Store results temporarily in internal variables
   - [ ] Print different results to different files

** Improvement goals
   - [X] Ability to run "Test All Quakes" with time quanta of different size
   - [X] Ability to run "Test All Quakes" with different number of quanta
   - [X] Ability to run "Test All Quakes" on different data files

** Plane-Distance testing
   - [X] Calculate the distance between one point and the quake plane
   - [ ] Model judgement based on mean squared distance (error)
   - [X] Is distance based on "in plane" distances for that model? or for both models?

** Fault distance testing
   - [ ] Calculate whether a fault is inside or outside the fault plane
   - [ ] Compare faults inside the fault plane with the strike direction

** Done
   - [X] Selects a subgroup of valid earthquakes
   Valid earthquakes have Magnitude > X, and aftershocks with mag > Z
   after 1 day > Y
   - [X] Calcular a hypothesis do plano para cada time period
   - [X] Imprimir o resultado para cada time period
